# Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits-with-Scikit-Learn-Package
The scikit-learn library (http://scikit-learn.org/ ) enables you to approach this type of data analysis in  a way that is slightly different from what youâ€™ve used throughout the book. The data to be analyzed is closely  related to numerical values or strings, but can also involve images and sounds. Therefore, it is clear that the problem you have to face in this chapter can be considered a prediction of  a numeric value, reading and interpreting an image that shows a handwritten font. So even in this case you will have an estimator with the task of learning through a fit() function, and  once it has reached a degree of predictive capability (a model sufficiently valid) , it will produce a prediction  with the predict() function. Then we will discuss the training set and validation set, compounds this time  from a series of images.
